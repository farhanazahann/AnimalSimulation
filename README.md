# AnimalSimulation
This project involves creating a custom ArrayList in C# to manage Cats, Snakes, and Birds. The simulation allows Cats and Snakes to chase and eat Birds within a range, implementing list operations like adding, deleting, sorting, and merging. Console visualization shows real-time animal movements until all Birds are consumed.
